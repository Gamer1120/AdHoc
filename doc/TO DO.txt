• You need to design and implement a multi-hop adhoc network between
the 4 devices of your group using WiFi.
• You can use the multicast facility of the WiFi network to send packets to
all other devices of your group which are within radio range of each other.
For Java, use the Multicast Socket class, see:
http://download.java.net/jdk7/archive/b123/docs/api/java/net/MulticastSocket.html
Also see Section 1.3 for more details.
(Corresponding instructions for C++ for the EE students will be added
later.)
• You will have to come up with some forwarding and routing mechanism
to also exchange packets between nodes which can reach each other only
via one or more intermediate nodes.
• Make sure your routing/forwarding algorithm is robust, so that even when
the connectivity changes, packets cannot run around endlessly.
• Each device should broadcast its presence periodically.
• You need to consider link unreliability and the packet lost probability and
ensure that messages are sent and received reliably. Think here about
using acknowledgements of sequence numbers, for example.

• You need to decide what type of messages you support in your chat application.
Think of short text messages, text files, audio files, or video
files.
• You need to ensure the order of sent messages at the receiving device. For
this, you may add time-stamp to each packet or a sequence number.
• Think how you can make the chat secure. You may consider for instance
encryption.
• Think about the user interface.
